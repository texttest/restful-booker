# restful-booker
A simple Node booking form for testing RESTful web services.

## Installation
1. Ensure mongo is up and running by executing ```mongod``` in your terminal
2. Clone the repo
3. Navigate into the restful-booker root folder
4. Run ```npm install```
5. Run ```npm start```

## API
API details can be found on the [publically deployed version of Restful-Booker](https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/).

## TextTests

This branch has some tests written using TextTest. Start the texttest GUI:

    texttest
    
Select and run tests. Note that you should not run the application with 'npm start' at the same time as running the tests. That will cause a port conflict.
